# Security

The security of a BDI implementation builds upon common security practices that every entity should put in place. Specific attention must be given to:

* Software design of components
* Emergent security (the security of the interacting components as an ensemble)
* Provisions to detect anomalies and perform autopsies after incidents
* Operational security
