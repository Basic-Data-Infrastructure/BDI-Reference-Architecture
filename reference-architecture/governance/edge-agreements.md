# Edge agreements

**1 Summary**

Edge Agreements are standards, terms and conditions, needed for non-BDI-compliant actors to interact with entities and/or persons that are BDI-compliant in an BDI Association. These Edge Agreements are active on the Association level.

**2 Purpose of the building block**

This chapter describes which elements should be included into an Edge Agreement, allowing for non-BDI members, on the edge of the network, to become part of a BDI Association to be able to interact with BDI members in a BDI Association.

**3 Concepts**

In the next figure you can see two associations. Association 1 is connected to the BDI root association, and the iSHARE Trust Framework. Association 2 is using a trust framework that is not known to the BDI. The member is part of Association 1 and has been onboarded in the BDI Root Association and has its compliancy with the iSHARE Frameworks, as the basis for trust withing the BDI Associations with other members. But in Association 2 there is a business partner of this BDI member. The business partner, coming from Association 2 wants to join in with Association 1 to do business with the BDI-compliant member.

This is possible if:

·      The business partner adheres to the Edge Agreements of the Association.

·      The business partner is vetted by an existing member of the BDI Root Association.

In this case the business partner becomes a preferred business partner and joins the Association 1 without onboarding into the BDI Root Association. The Edge Agreements now describe the T’s and C’s, all joined in the Association 1, have to adhere to independent of their BDI-compliancy level. In this way actors from other data spaces can join in BDI Associations.
