# 🚛 Logistics Event KIT



## 1. Introduction

In fast-moving, operational environments—whether in logistics, infrastructure, mobility, or beyond—effective coordination depends on timely and reliable information sharing between autonomous organizations. The **Basic Data Infrastructure (BDI)** supports this through **event-driven coordination**: a way for distributed parties to align their actions based on real-world events.

The **Logistics Event Kit** offers a reference pattern for applying this event-based approach in practice. It enables operational visibility, dynamic collaboration, and faster responses to change — without requiring tight system integration or centralized control.

At its core, the approach treats **events** — such as a delay, a delivery, or a status update — as signals that drive coordination. These events capture the operational reality as it unfolds. When shared with the right parties at the right moment, they enable each actor to make informed decisions, fulfill their role, and stay aligned with the broader process.

### 1.1 Event-driven coordination

Some benefits of event-driven coordination are the following:&#x20;

* **Reflects real-world dynamics.** Plans often change; coordination must follow what’s actually happening.
* **Supports flexibility**. Events help autonomous systems work together without direct coupling.
* **Improves responsiveness**. Early signals allow actors to adjust quickly and avoid bottlenecks.
* **Fosters accountability.** Shared events form a transparent timeline of what occurred.

While event-driven models are well known, the BDI framework makes them usable within a federative network. It provides the trust, structure, and agreements needed for sharing event information across organizational boundaries — while preserving data ownership and system independence.

The pages that follow introduce the main components of this approach.
