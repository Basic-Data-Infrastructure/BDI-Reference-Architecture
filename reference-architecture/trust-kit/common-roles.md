# Common Roles

Some roles are generic to the BDI building blocks.

**Generic Common Roles**

BDI defines these Common Roles :

* Identity Provider and/or Identity Broker
* Association Administrator
* Data Owner
* Data Service Provider&#x20;
* Data Consumer

## Concepts

| Role                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Identity Provider         | The Identity Provider-role is fulfilled by a legal entity whose tooling identifies and authenticates humans (and specifically, Human Data Consumers representing Data Consumers).                                                                          |
| Identity Broker           | The **Identity Broker**-role is fulfilled by a legal entity that provides Data Service Providers access to different Identity Providers, and that offers humans the option to choose with which Identity Provider to identify and authenticate themselves. |
| Association Administrator |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Data Owner                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Data Service Provider     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Data Consumer             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Implementation Considerations

Th basic mechanisms are built upon the assumptions of the existence of these roles.

## Interlinkages with other building blocks

* Digital Identity
* Authentication
* Authorisation
* Association Register
* Zero Trust Check

## Elements and their key functions



## Core design decisions

The iSHARE Trust Framework provides a comprehensive description of what iSHARE calls Certified Roles. The Common Roles of the BDI are derived from these descriptions, such as:

* [The role of an Authorisation Registry](https://framework.ishare.eu/is/framework-and-roles)
* [The role of Identity Provider](https://framework.ishare.eu/is/functional-requirements-per-role#Functionalrequirementsperrole-IdentityProvider)
