# Digital Asset Boundaries

Digital assets are:

\-          Applications and processes

\-          Data

Allowing humans to login to your  IT systems (applications, processes),  or allowing an process owned by another party to  access (read and maybe modify) your data is the subject of Digital Asset Boundary Management.

This subject is well understood by most organizations and covered by the main parts of the Trust Kit:

\-          Digital Identification

\-          Authentication

\-          Authorization
