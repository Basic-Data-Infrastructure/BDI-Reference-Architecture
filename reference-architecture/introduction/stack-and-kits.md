# Stack and KITs

## 1. BDI Stack and KITs

To assist the creation of applications according to the architectural principles, BDI defines a set of _building blocks._ Each building block provides tools and guidelines to implement parts of the required functionality. The building blocks are shown in the BDI stack:

Implementation of the principles by means of parts of the stack is aided by the definition of **KITs**. A KIT is a subset of the BDI stack that forms a coherent capability. Implementing a KIT makes it easier to start with a minimal viable subset and add additional functionality later as the need for it arises.
