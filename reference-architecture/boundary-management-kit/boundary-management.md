# Boundary Management



Usually, many parties are involved in a logistic process. Each of these parties maintains a set of valuable assets that he needs to protect. In abstract terms, this protection is realized by drawing a boundary around the assets. Other parties can not cross the boundary and hence the value is protected. However, it is often required that parties do cross the boundary to facilitate cooperation.

Three different kinds of assets and their associated boundaries are distinguished:

* Digital assets, such as IT systems and data
* Physical assets, such as distribution centers and production facilities
* Legal assets, such as responsibilities and ownership of cargo

The nature and implementation of the protecting boundaries is different for each kind of assets and each one requires specific measures to allow third parties to cross them in order to cooperate in a logistic process.

There are two reasons to allow others to cross a boundary

* To allow them to use an asset
* To transfer the asset to another party
