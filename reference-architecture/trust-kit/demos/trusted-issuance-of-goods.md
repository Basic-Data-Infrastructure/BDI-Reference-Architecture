# Trusted Goods Release & Delegation

### Introduction

**Demo Phase 1**

The "Trusted Goods Release" demo aimed to establish a secure process for the handover of high-value goods within a logistics network. This demonstration illustrated a streamlined approach using trust-based protocols, enabling seamless, authenticated, and authorized goods collection. It showed how essential logistics operations could be managed through digital verification, focusing on the Base Data Infrastructure (BDI) and iSHARE Trust frameworks for enhanced security and efficiency in goods transfer.

The demo illustrated a trusted goods release scenario, focusing on a high-value, business-to-business (B2B) shipment within a controlled logistics process. Key achievements included:

* Validating the iSHARE Trust framework and BDI components in a real-world setting.
* Demonstrating the secure handoff of shipments by incorporating "need-to-know" data-sharing practices.
* Establishing an efficient digital verification process to authenticate authorized personnel and vehicles for pickups.

**Demo Phase 2**

The "Delegation Demo" (Demo 2) built upon the original "Trusted Goods Release" process by introducing a delegation mechanism. This extension demonstrated how the trusted goods release protocol can be further refined with subcontractor involvement, showing enhanced control and flexibility within the logistics process. This demo utilized iSHARE and BDI frameworks to incorporate delegated authority in a seamless and secure manner.

In Demo 2, the focus was on implementing a delegation framework, expanding on the core process demonstrated in Demo 1. Key elements included:

Documented lessons learned and areas for improvement are available (attached to this article), as well as illustration of proposed process flow.
