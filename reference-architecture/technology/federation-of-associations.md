# Federation of Associations

## Summary

This building block encompasses key points for effective interoperability and federation amongst associations. The BDI framework sets internal rules and policies applicable to all association members. Beyond this the associations independently define a standard for trust and reliability amongst its members through a well defined onboarding process and assessment. It then issues credentials for the same. These credentials can also be used by other associations or communities for trust assurance. This is  Federation of Associations.

## Purpose of the building block

This block is vital in trust implementation within the Association and widening this scope to other associations. This helps create a network effect and federate the BDI Framework.

**Concepts :**&#x20;

| Role                  | Description                                                                                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Association           | Legal entity that serves as operational anchor for both federated trust/authentication and local onboarding.  |
| Association Admin     | Functionary responsible for operating the services of a BDI Association                                       |
| Association Register  | <p>Register of onboarded Members</p><p></p>                                                                   |

## Implementation Considerations

There are two layers of Federation :&#x20;

iSHARE base layer - all participants in the iSHARE network are onboarded with the same base criteria and hence fulfill base trust level.&#x20;

BDI Framework level - all participants in the BDI associations are onboarded with base iSHARE onboarding/ admission process and other criteria defined by the BDI framework.&#x20;

Beyond these two layers, associations are free to define additional criteria for joining for their members.&#x20;

**International standards and alignment with other frameworks for data sharing**

Data Space Frameworks such as iSHARE, GAIA-X and IDSA are architectures to create a federated cooperation in networks to exchange or access data, based on principles of:

* Data Sovereignty
* Control of who can access what data is held by the data owner;
* Shared semantic models;
* Accessing data directly at the source, machine-to-machine;
* Machine-to-machine Identification, Authentication and Authorization (IAA) for confidential access to data at the source.

These Frameworks will also need to be interoperable for their members or participants to realize the full scope of data spaces. Interoperability would be multi-folded with alignment required on both technical components and trust elements or claims.

## Interlinkages with other building blocks

This building block complements the Zero Trust Check, Verifiable Credentials and Business Partner Reputation Model.&#x20;

This building block is also related to Association Register and Onboarding T\&C's Association articles.

## Elements and their key functions

Federation of Associations creates:&#x20;

1. Trust Assurance outside the association
2. A Perimeter-less network

The Association Admin is a key role in the Federation of Associations  &#x20;

Association Admin&#x20;

* responsible for developing and maintaining as well as operating the established Association
* entails various functions, such as setting internal rules and policies, ensuring compliance with internal and external rules, and resolving conflicts that may arise.&#x20;
* creates mechanisms for continuous improvement of the association, identity management, access controls and risk mitigation to build trust and quality within the association.&#x20;
* Standardise credentials that are acceptable in the association and can also be agreed upon to be acceptable with other associations

## Core design decisions

* Federation is key to expanding the scope and functional significance of local associations.&#x20;
* Associations donâ€™t function in silos and zero trust approach requires federation of key trust elements or credentials.&#x20;
* As most organizations will be active in multiple sectors, the question of supporting interoperability between different sectors is a key challenge. Federation is finding common ground for trust among associations.&#x20;
* Associations need pre-defined rules or agreements  to verify the claims an entity makes about itself, by links to the registers of Conformity Assessment Bodies that are responsible for certifying a claim. Claims may be anything, such as:  Identity; ISO certification of the organization; Credentials of a certain training level of a person; etc.
* Federated data space frameworks provide a federated trust framework: this is the basis to check claims (identities and other claims) automatically, and provide access to data at the source when authorized.

## Future topics

* Credentials for Federation
* &#x20;Interoperability of Associations&#x20;
