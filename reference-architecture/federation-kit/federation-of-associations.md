# Federation of Associations

## 1. Summary

This building block encompasses key points for effective interoperability and federation amongst associations.

## 2. Purpose of the building block

This block is vital in trust implementation within the Association and widening this scope to other associations. This helps create a network effect and federate the BDI Framework.

**Concepts**

| Role                 | Description                                                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Association          | Legal entity that serves as operational anchor for both federated trust/authentication and local onboarding. |
| Association Admin    | Functionary responsible for operating the services of a BDI Association                                      |
| Association Register | Register of onboarded Members and Preferred Business Partners                                                |

## 3. Implementation Considerations

The Discovery mechanism supports an open and loose model without a centralized register that could be searched for all existing BDI Associations. In theory a large number of independent BDI Associations could co-exist without further governance.

In practice it is expected that BDI Associations will form federations and voluntarily agree upon common standards, roles and semantics over a group of Associations.

## 4. Interlinkages with other building blocks

This building block complements the following building blocks:

## 5. Elements and their key functions

Federation of Associations creates:

1. Trust Assurance outside the association
2. A Perimeter-less network

The Association Admin is a key role in the Federation of Associations

Association Admin

* responsible for developing and maintaining as well as operating the established Association
* entails various functions, such as setting internal rules and policies, ensuring compliance with internal and external rules, and resolving conflicts that may arise.
* creates mechanisms for continuous improvement of the association, identity management, access controls and risk mitigation to build trust and quality within the association.
* Standardize credentials that are acceptable in the association and can also be agreed upon to be acceptable with other associations

## 6. Core design decisions

* Federation is key to expanding the scope and functional significance of local associations.
* Associations don’t function in silos and zero trust approach requires federation of key trust elements or credentials.
* As most organizations will be active in multiple sectors, the question of supporting interoperability between different sectors is a key challenge. Federation is finding common ground for trust among associations.

## 7. Future topics

* Credentials for Federation
* Interoperability of Associations
