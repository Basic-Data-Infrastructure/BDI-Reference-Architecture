# Discovery

## Introduction

The purpose of the discovery building block is to discover the endpoints of participants to speed up establishing a connection for data exchange. Discovery will require a standardized method of publication.



## Purpose

Key difference to understand in the Discovery Building Block in the BDI vs Data Space Support Centre purpose is that in the BDI we don't expect a primary use case in which Data product providers are wanting to reach their potential consumers, and vice versa, to establish relationships that will result in data sharing. Our validated working hypothesis is that parties are already exchanging (vast amounts of) data supporting the operational logistics in the supply chain but the methods are disparate rendering it inefficient (re-use, duplication, comprehending meaning or even full failure to exchange).

So when parties are already connected in the real world, how do we make connecting in the Digital Twin as easy as possible?

The discovery building block enables:

* data owners to publish their endpoints exposing their supported capabilities to one, federated or all associations, and
* data consumers to determine the characteristics, and terms and conditions, fit their needs and requirements, and proceed to request access.
