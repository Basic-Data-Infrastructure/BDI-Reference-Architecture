# Trust KIT

The TRUST KIT serves as the foundational pillar of the Basic Data Infrastructure (BDI), ensuring secure and reliable data exchange within a BDI Association. As the core KIT, it integrates critical capabilities that empower organizations to establish and operate a BDI Association while leveraging the BDI Identity, Authentication, and Authorization (IAA) solution. The TRUST KIT is essential for authorizing and delegating data access through established APIs, offering a robust framework for managing trust relationships and data governance.&#x20;

At its core, the TRUST KIT encompasses vital building blocks, including IAA functions that provide the necessary identity and access management capabilities. The Association Register and Authorization Register enable the secure recording of membership and authorization rights. Discovery and Onboarding processes ensure that members can be seamlessly integrated into the BDI, guided by clearly defined Terms & Conditions and structured process flows. Furthermore, Policy Agreements and Edge Agreements provide the necessary governance framework to ensure that all data interactions comply with agreed-upon standards and regulations.&#x20;

By implementing the TRUST KIT, organizations lay the groundwork for a secure, scalable, and interoperable BDI, making it the most crucial KIT within the BDI ecosystem.&#x20;
