# 🤝 Trust KIT

## 1. Introduction

The Trust KIT serves as the foundational pillar of the Basic Data Infrastructure (BDI), ensuring secure and reliable data exchange within a BDI Association. As the core KIT, it integrates critical capabilities that empower organizations to establish and operate a BDI Association while leveraging the BDI Identity, Authentication, and Authorization (IAA) solution. The Trust KIT is essential for authorizing and delegating data access through established APIs, offering a robust framework for managing trust relationships and data governance.

Trust is the measure to which one believes that another entity (being a person, an organization or a support system) is willing and able to fulfill an agreement. Measures can be in place to increase trust. For instance, encryption, signing certificates and the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) are in place to increase trust in a message exchange over the internet.

### 1.1 Trust in the BDI

The BDI is mainly concerned with trust at the business level, i.e. trust between parties in a business transaction. However, as data exchange over a network is crucial for the BDI, we make extensive use of tools and techniques to increase trust at a technical level.

### 1.2 The Trust KIT

The Trust KIT is inspired by the iSHARE Trust Framework, and uses some of the concepts and components from iSHARE. However, the BDI is not identical to iSHARE.

At its core, the Trust KIT encompasses vital building blocks, including IAA functions that provide the necessary identity and access management capabilities. The Association Register and Authorization Registers enable the secure recording of membership and authorization rights. Discovery and Onboarding processes ensure that members can be seamlessly integrated into the BDI, guided by clearly defined Terms & Conditions and structured process flows. Furthermore, Policy Agreements and Edge Agreements provide the necessary governance framework to ensure that all data interactions comply with agreed-upon standards and regulations.
