# BDI Association Roles

## 1. Summary

BDI defines Common Roles as the standardized roles for activities in a specific sector or type of supply chain. They form the basis for standardized role-based authorizations, lowering the effort for maintaining authorization rules. .

This type of roles is sector specific, as opposed to BDI Roles that are part of the building blocks

See Policy Agreements.

**Sector specific Common Roles**

Common roles define operational responsibilities within supply chains, helping to create standardized policies, particularly Data Access Policies.

Each specific sector (type of cargo, modality) has common roles that are well understood and recognized. The same applies to data elements that a role needs to have access to, in order to be able to perform a task.

Defining these common roles (like truck driver, customs agents, inspection agent, forwarder, terminal planner, etc. etc.) reduces the cost of interactions between entities. An undefined role needs custom definitions for the combination role-data access policy: a labour-intensive action.

Managing access rights is simplified by standardization.

Members of different Associations that have different policies per common role, or different roles, will need to align these policies and roles to become interoperable. It is expected that a natural convergence on common roles in a sector will appear over time: Associations will agree upon shared common roles and policies if this benefits their business objectives.
