# 🖇️ Association Register (Suus)

## 1. Introduction

{% hint style="warning" %}
An Association is a legal entity, created and governed by its members, that provides the neutral rules and\
structures needed to enable trusted data sharing between companies.
{% endhint %}

The Association Register (ASR) is an important component in the BDI architecture. It is a centralized component that enables efficient data sharing between independent companies by providing a neutral member-governed entity that serves as a trust anchor. BDI connectors query the ASR to establish a trusted data exchange between participants.&#x20;
