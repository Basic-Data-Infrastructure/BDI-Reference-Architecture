# Logistics Event KIT

The Logistics Events KIT is an essential component of the Basic Data Infrastructure (BDI), specifically designed to enable the exchange of logistics events and associated data across the BDI ecosystem. This KIT is vital for organizations that require real-time visibility and coordination within their logistics operations. Building on the secure foundation provided by the TRUST KIT, it utilizes the BDI control plane and Identity, Authentication, and Authorization (IAA) functions to ensure that event data is exchanged securely and efficiently.

The core building block of the Logistics Events KIT is the Pub/Sub service, which allows for the publication and subscription of logistics events. This service facilitates the timely and reliable distribution of event-related information, ensuring that all relevant parties receive critical updates as they happen. By integrating with the BDI control plane, the Logistics Events KIT ensures that all data exchanges comply with established security protocols and governance frameworks set by the TRUST KIT.

Implementing the Logistics Events KIT enables organizations to streamline their logistics processes, improve real-time decision-making, and enhance overall supply chain efficiency. It is a crucial addition for any BDI deployment that involves dynamic and event-driven logistics operations, ensuring that data flows seamlessly and securely throughout the system.
