## BDI: An Infrastructure Framework for Operations and Supply Chain Data Spaces

Operations and Supply Chain Management (OSCM) represents the science and expertise of value creation in the production and distribution networks of goods and services. Effective information sharing is an operational necessity within and across these networks for establishing agreements, coordinating actions and handovers, controlling access to resources and data, and ensuring compliance with authorities. The challenge is to increase effectiveness by automating these exchanges and increase operational visibility and transparency.

Resilience, efficiency, dealing with scarce resources and transparency require more, better and timely information. To keep the administrative burden manageable (especially for SMEs that carry out many of the operational activities) more automation is needed to meet the growing call for more information: automation of the exchange of information.

The Basic Data Infrastructure Framework (BDI) is an infrastructure framework for controlled data sharing, supporting automated advanced information logistics between entities acting in the physical economy.

The BDI is a principles-based framework (as opposed to rule-based). Adoption is voluntary: there is no minimum or compliance threshold. The transition towards adoption of principles, components and Kits is purely a business decision.
