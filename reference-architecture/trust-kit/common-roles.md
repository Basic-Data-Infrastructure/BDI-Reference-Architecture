| Identity Provider         | The Identity Provider-role is fulfilled by a legal entity whose tooling identifies and authenticates humans (and specifically, Human Data Consumers representing Data Consumers).                                                                          |
| Identity Broker           | The **Identity Broker**-role is fulfilled by a legal entity that provides Data Service Providers access to different Identity Providers, and that offers humans the option to choose with which Identity Provider to identify and authenticate themselves. |
| Association Administrator |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
