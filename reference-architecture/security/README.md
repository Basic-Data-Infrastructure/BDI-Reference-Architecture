# Security

### Summary

The BDI provides security measures based on ISO 27001. This is an internationally recognized standard for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an Information Security Management System (ISMS).

In essence, ISO 27001 provides a framework for organizations to establish a robust and comprehensive information security management system that helps them protect their valuable assets and infrastructure. This page contains a breakdown of the key measures it encompasses.

### Purpose of this building block

{% hint style="info" %}
This building block provides guidelines to implement security measures to prevent unauthorized access to data
{% endhint %}

### 1. Information Security Policy:

* Foundation: The cornerstone of the ISMS.
* Scope: Defines the organization's commitment to information security, outlining its scope, objectives, and responsibilities.
* Key Elements:
  * Confidentiality: Protecting sensitive data from unauthorized disclosure.
  * Integrity: Ensuring the accuracy and completeness of information.
  * Availability: Guaranteeing timely and reliable access to information when needed.
  * Accountability: Assigning responsibility for information security to individuals and departments.

### 2. Risk Assessment and Treatment:

* Identification: Identifying potential threats to information assets (e.g., cyberattacks, natural disasters, human error).
* Analysis: Evaluating the likelihood and impact of these threats.
* Treatment: Implementing controls to mitigate identified risks. This can involve:
  * Risk Avoidance: Eliminating the risk altogether.
  * Risk Mitigation: Reducing the likelihood or impact of the risk.
  * Risk Transfer: Shifting the risk to another party (e.g., insurance). &#x20;
  * Risk Acceptance: Accepting the risk based on a cost-benefit analysis.

### 3. Control Implementation:

* Selecting Controls: Choosing appropriate security controls from Annex A of ISO 27001. These controls address a wide range of security areas, including:
  * Access Control: Restricting access to information based on need-to-know principles.
  * Physical Security: Protecting physical assets such as servers, data centers, and mobile devices.
  * Cryptography: Using encryption to protect data in transit and at rest.
  * Incident Management: Establishing procedures for responding to security incidents.
  * Business Continuity Management: Ensuring the continued operation of critical business functions in the event of a disruption.
* Implementation and Documentation:
  * Implementing the selected controls and documenting their implementation.

### 4. Monitoring, Measurement, Analysis, and Improvement:

* Internal Audits: Conducting regular internal audits to assess the effectiveness of the ISMS.
* Management Reviews: Conducting periodic reviews by management to evaluate the overall performance of the ISMS and identify areas for improvement.
* Corrective and Preventive Actions: Implementing corrective actions to address identified nonconformities and preventive actions to prevent future problems.
* Continuous Improvement: Continuously improving the ISMS based on feedback from audits, reviews, and other sources.

### Key Benefits of Implementing ISO 27001:

* Enhanced security posture: Reduces the risk of data breaches, cyber attacks, and other security incidents.
* Increased customer trust: Demonstrates a commitment to data protection and security.
* Improved operational efficiency: Streamlines security processes and reduces the costs associated with security incidents.
* Enhanced compliance: Helps organizations comply with relevant regulations and legal requirements.
* Competitive advantage: Differentiates the organization from competitors by demonstrating a strong commitment to information security.
