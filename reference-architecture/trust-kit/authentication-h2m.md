# Authentication H2M

### Summary&#x20;

Authentication is the process of proving that the user (human or IT process) with a digital identity who is requesting access is the rightful owner of that identity (definition from IDpro).

Authentication is required in both H2M (Human to Machine) and M2M (Machine to Machine) use cases. In this page  we focus on H2M use cases: the human interacts with a machine by means of an IT-process under its direct control (device, IT-process, wallet etc.), or by digital data (e.g. QR code).

Requesting access in H2M interactions can have multiple meanings:

\-          Requesting access to data

\-          Requesting access to a location

\-          Requesting permission to perform an action

* For example:
  * Loading of unloading of cargo
  * Submitting compliance documents or compliance data
  * &#x20;Inspection of cargo
  * &#x20;Etc.

In the context of the BDI, the human is a representative of a legal entity  (organization): the legal entity assumes accountability and liability for the actions of the representative, limited to the mandate of the representative. A human can have multiple roles for multiple legal entities simultaneously.

The complexity of H2M authentication is increased by privacy regulations: authenticating a human reveals his/hers identity.

### Purpose of the building block&#x20;

Ensure that BDI users (H2M) are recognized,  identified  as a person and in a specific role on behalf of a legal entity: to prevent misuse, fraud, theft of data, services and physical goods. Ensure that privacy leaks as a result of authentication are limited.
